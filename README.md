## IMDB movie rating

The purpose of this project was to predict the imdb rating of a sample data of movies taken from Duke University database. 
The dataset contained information from Rotten Tomatoes. 
A prediction model was developed using R with an accuracy of 96%. 
The prediction model helps to answer the following questionnaire:

* Is an Oscar winning actor or actress in the cast associated with the imdb rating of the movie?
* Is there a difference in mean audience scores between genres?
* Which variables are associated with, and hence can be used to predict, the rating of a movie on imdb?
